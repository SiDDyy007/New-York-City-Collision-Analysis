# New-York-City-Collision-Analysis
Project as part of my course work in CS225 - Spatial Computing.

Constructed 5 Geo-Spatial filters and charted visualizations using Geo-pandas on NYC Collision data-set.

Developed Machine Learning Models to detect collision hot spots for pedestrians using Logistic Regression (91%).
